# IoT final project: Face Detection on taking attendance

Taking attendance in class by manual is a conventional way to know the students' attendance level. It may be time-consuming to take attendance. Also, teacher may make mistake to write down an inaccurate data. Nowadays, face detection becomes the trend and is applied to many applications. For me, I wanna to use this 
technology on taking attendance by ueing python API OpenCV-OpenVINO in Raspberry pi.

## Required items
* Raspberry pi 3 (Model B)
* Raspberry pi Power supply
* Raspberry Pi 3.5 Inch LCD with HDMI
* Raspberry pi camera NoIR/w CS   
 

## Component Make-Up

## Raspberry Pi Environment Setting

* If you start with a new raspberry pi, you need to set the basic environment before going on.
(Please refer to the attached file: RaspberryPi_setting.pdf)

* Then we set the OpenVINO. All of the steps are clearly written down in the OpenVINO official document. Just follow it step-by-step.

[Install OpenVINO™ toolkit for Raspbian* OS](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_raspbian.html)

*  Now everything are deployed. Let's start coding.

## Programming

In my project, there are two python files and three xml files in *FaceRecognition* folder. Let's analysis how to code works.

### Step 1: Import the packages
`import cv2`	
`from lineNotifyMessage import lineNotifyMessage`

Import cv2 API and lineNotifyMessage from lineNotifyMessage.py
### Step 2: Set camera
	faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
	 
	cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) #get the camera
	 
	cap.set(3,960) # set Width
	 
	cap.set(4,720) # set Height
	 
	count = 0 #count

Use the trained model haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml to detect people face.
### Step 3: Start to detect faces

Use while loop to detect faces continually.
If you want to know more about cv2 packages and attributes. Please refer to the tutorial below.

### Step 4 : Block the detected face
	if count < 5:
            cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(0,255,0),2)
            roi_gray = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            roi_color = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        
    if count >= 5:
            cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(0,0,255),2)
            roi_gray = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            roi_color = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
